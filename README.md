# Reward System Web App 

A Django-based web application that has two main components:

1. **Admin Facing:** Allows admins to manage Android apps and assign points to users.  
2. **User Facing:** Enables users to sign up, complete tasks such as downloading apps, and upload screenshots as proof to earn points.  

All features are also available via REST APIs with proper authentication, permissions, and documentation.
